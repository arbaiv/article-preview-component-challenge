## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to copy the current url to the clipboard and how to make an element unclickable.

### Continued development

Need to build more projects.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49618618/copy-current-url-to-clipboard) - I wanted to add an event to the #share-text element. So that when the link is clicked the url of the page will be copied to the clipboard.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) - I had a bug where the share links section was clickable when it was not on the screen. It happened due to the animation I added. So, I used pointer-events property to make it unclickable when it's not visible.
